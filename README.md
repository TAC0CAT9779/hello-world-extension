# hello-world-extension
My first Chrome extension.\
I'm just following Google Chrome's [tutorial for making a Hello World extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world).\
I plan on making more sophisticated stuff in the future.\
All it does is say Hello Extensions when you click it.\
If you inspect the extension and go to console, there should be a popup that says "This is a popup!"
